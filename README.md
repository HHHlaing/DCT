# Data-Centric Toolkit

This repository contains Pollere's evolving work on tools to enable data-centric applications (with a focus on "edge" applications). It is organized into directories, only one of which is currently available:

versec: contains tools and examples for using trust schema-based security. It includes a description of the VerSec Language for expressing trust rules and a compiler that turns the language into a binary trust schema. Examples trust schemas are provided.
