### versec -- Versatile Security for Data-Centric Transport

This repo contains a description of the DCT "trust schema" domain-specific language, a compiler for that language, example trust schemas, and a detailed description of the dnmp schema example.

SchemaCompile source is not yet ready for release. Binaries for schemaCompile (linux and macOS) are available on the project releases page. 

This work was originally submitted as an appendix to a final report to NIST on the DNMP project (SBIR grant 70NANB18H186) in February of 2019.
