## Versatile Security (VerSec)

This directory contains documentation for the VerSec language and how to express trust schemas in the language, binaries for both linux (ubuntu 20.10) and macOS versions of schemaCompile which turns those trust schemas into binary form, and illustrative examples.

The language is documented in language.md and schema examples in the language are provided in dnmp.schema and sample.schema. Each example's schemaCompile output (debug option) is included. Compressed tar files for the binaries are available here.

An early version of the language and the compiler output for DNMP was included as an Appendix entitled "Pollere Trust Schema Compiler" in the Final Technical Progress Report submitted to NIST on February 27, 2019, for SBIR grant 70NANB18H186.
